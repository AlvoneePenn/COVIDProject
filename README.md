## Introduction
We have wrangled, cleaned, and extracted information from the CDC's [open data repository](https://healthdata.gov/Health/COVID-19-Community-Profile-Report/gqxm-d9w9) related to the Delta variant of COVID-19. Our aim is to better display the state of the pandemic in the South Florida region of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties.
